This dataset was created within the EU-funded project EXCITEMENT (EXploring Customer Interactions through Textual EntailMENT) to evaluate the task of automatically categorizing German customer requests. The dataset consists of a set emails and online requests sent to the support center of a multimedia software company. The customer requests contain issues reported by customers concerning the company's products. Each email was manually assigned to one or more matching category. Each category represents an issue reported by one or several customers.
